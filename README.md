# Predicting rock Lithology using Machine learning
Lithology indicates the differences in the mineral composition, organic matter content, brittleness index and other relevant parameters. These parameters play a cricial role in the prediction and calculation of the amount of resources in an oil and gas area. The identification of a rock's lithology is fundamental to all reservoir characterization because the physical and chemical properties of the rock that holds hydrocarbons and/or water affect the response of every tool used to measure formation properties. Understanding reservoir lithology is the foundation from which all other petrophysical calculations are made. To make accurate petrophysical calculations of porosity, water saturation (Sw), and permeability, the various lithologies of the reservoir interval must be identified and their implications understood. Lithology means "the composition or type of rock such as sandstone or limestone."

* Obtaining a physical sample of the reservoir is the surest way to unabigously determine lithology and rock type.  But obtaining the physical sample is not always easy
* If no direct sample is available in a given zone, log responses alone must be used simulatenoeusly to determine rock lithology. But one has to be lucky enough to encounter parts of the desired reservor below the free water level to determine parts of the gross lithology from outine wireline logs. 
* Acoustic velocity which is primarily a function of the rock matrix can be used to identify different lithologies and for stratigraphic correlations. However, the ratio the compressional velocity to shear velocity which is supposed to be an effective indicator of lithology is affected by formation anisotropy


## What is my objective? What am I offering?
Having Identified the challenges associated with accurately predicting and identifying the lithology of a rock. My objective is to develop a model, accurately and precisely predicts lithology of a rock using the location of the well, the well depth and the well logs. A model that eliminates the need of going subsurface to get physical sample, a model that
* Saves cost
* Optimizes time
